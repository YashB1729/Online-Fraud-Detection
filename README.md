# Online-Fraud-Detection
Performance evaluation and comparison of conventional models and ensemble methods in online fraud detection.

Welcome to the Online Fraud Detection project! This repository contains my work on building and comparing machine learning models to detect and prevent fraudulent activities online.

ðŸ“œ Overview
Fraud detection is a critical challenge in the modern digital landscape. This project explores various machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent transactions with high accuracy. The focus is on experimenting with different models, analyzing their performance, and understanding trade-offs to choose the most efficient solution.

ðŸš€ Features
Advanced ML Techniques: Implemented Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
Ensemble Models: Developed and compared Voting and Stacking classifiers for robust predictions.
Evaluation Metrics: Precision-Recall, ROC Curve analysis, and other metrics for model performance.
Data Preprocessing: Feature scaling, encoding, and handling imbalanced datasets.
